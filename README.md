# UndergraduateLabs


This repository contains relevant codes for some of the most important labs, that I had in my undergraduate course. 
All of these labs had a similar pattern in which they were conducted. Every week we would be given a couple of problems pertaining to the topic being discussed
for the same, that we had to solve in a span of 3 hours. Based on the number of problems that we would solve, and the number of testcases, each of our solutions 
would pass, we would be graded. It should be noted that, some of the labs in the later semesters also had a mandatory capstone project, the details of which are provided in the table below.
